#### Project Abstract

HomeCookHub aspires to unify the fragmented world of online culinary resources into a singular, holistic platform. Our primary goal is to confront and simplify the multifaceted challenges encountered by home cooks. These range from planning varied and nutritious meals, maintaining organized grocery lists, customizing recipes to align with specific dietary restrictions, acquiring new culinary skills, to making environmentally conscious and sustainable decisions in the kitchen.
