# Hour Summary: John Thompson
### Semester 1: 48.0
### Semester 2: 49.5

### Justification: 
My role in this project was mainly the back end side, I added in key features into this project such as the search funcionality and the add recipe page. During the first semester, I took part in designing the application, going to the meeting and deciding what needs to be done. I learned a lot about our code stack that we are going to be using for our project. I learned about the functionality of firebase and touched up on my typescipt to get started on the project. For the first semester I started on the log in page and the search function.

For the second semester, I finished up on the search function. Then I created the add recipe functionality. I worked on the front and the back end so I had to learn more about react and typescript to ensure I have the right design. I also wrote the back end functionality so that the web app would connect to the API and add a recipe into the database. I also worked with the team to make sure we are on the right track and work on the deliverables for the class.
