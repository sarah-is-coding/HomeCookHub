Our application can be considered a social media app and with that comes storing the personal information of our users. We will need to ensure that our data is secure so that the information that the user does not want to be public remains private. Data like dietary restrictions, location, emails, and passwords all need to be hidden so that our users feel safe and protected when using our app.

HomeCookHub isn't just about recipes; it's about bringing people together. At its core, it serves a broader public purpose by providing a space where users can share meals, traditions, and experiences. While not directly aimed at non-profit agencies, the platform can be a valuable tool for organizations promoting healthy eating or sustainable food sources. Beyond its functional aspects, HomeCookHub has societal benefits too. By simplifying meal planning, it gives families more time together. The platform can also be a cultural bridge, introducing users to diverse cuisines and fostering community. In short, HomeCookHub goes beyond food, enriching lives and building connections.

With our app, there are some legality that we have to be mindful of during development. One of those things is the copyright of recipes, we have to make sure that the recipes we use, such as the name of the food, the process of making it and the ingredients that make it do not fall on any possible copyright. Another legal issue we have to keep in mind is to follow the terms of service of all the software and platforms that we are using to develop and support our app. This includes building our website backend using firebase, so we have to make sure we align with the firebase terms of service. Additionally if we are going to put our app on a mobile app store, we have to make sure that we follow the terms of service of the app store so our mobile app can stay on it for users to download.

Food is a critical component of culture. With that in mind, our app will primarily focus on American culture. It will be programmed and contain content in English and the initial recipes we use to create our database will be foods common in America. The planned scope of this project includes implementing the ability for users to upload their own recipes to HomeCookHub. While this does offer the potential for a diversity of recipes from other cultures, and the features we implement will be able to support this, our target is for this to be a primarily American app as that is what we are familiar with. That is the knowledge we will be drawing on as we develop our meal planner and grocery list functionalities and it is likely that we will have blind spots when it comes to the food of other cultures.
