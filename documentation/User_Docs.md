## Starting HomeCookHub
Currently, HomeCookHub is still in development; you will need to run the code locally. To run the app, you will first need to have a copy of the code on your computer. Make sure that all required modules are installed.

To run the application, first navigate to the HomeCookHub\api directory, then run the command `npm start`. This will start the api which allows the application to communicate with the database. Next, in a separate terminal window, navigate to the HomeCookHub\App\Web directory. Run the command `npm start`. You can now go to http:localhost:3000/ to access the web application.

## User Profile
If you are logged in, you can navigate to the user profile in the top right of the screen designated by the person icon. Once clicked you will be able to see your username and profile picture along with two tabs. You can switch between these two tabs to show profile info or saved recipes. Recipes can be saved from the home page or the recipe search page. Once saved, they will be viewable in your profile page.

## Adding a Recipe 
To add a new recipe to HomeCookHub, navigate to the recipe search page. Here, you'll find an option to "Add a Recipe," which will take you to a separate page dedicated to recipe creation. On this page, you will be prompted to enter information about your recipe, including the title, ingredients, preparation steps, cooking time, and an image that best represents your dish. Once you've filled in all the required fields, you can submit your recipe by clicking the "Post" button. This will upload your recipe to the HomeCookHub database, making it searchable and savable by other users.

## Interacting with Meal Plans
The meal planning tab is where you will be able to set the recipes you plan on making to specific dates on the calendar. Once you select a date on the calendar, you will be able to see 3 slots for recipe cards tied to that date. You will then be able to add any of your saved recipes to these slots to plan them for that day. You can continue to do this for any day in the future. Once added to your meal plan it will also update your grocery list.

## Searching for a recipe
Clicking on the recipes tab at the top will take you to the recipe page. There you will find a search bar. Type in your search in the search bar and a list of 20 recipes will show up on the page. The recipes are in order from closest to farthest from what you are searching.

## Interacting with Individual Recipes 
When you find a recipe you're interested in on HomeCookHub, clicking on the recipe will take you to a detailed recipe page. This page showcases the recipe's title, an image, and a star rating system, allowing you to quickly see how others have rated the recipe. Below the image, you'll find a detailed description, the list of ingredients, and the cooking instructions.

Each recipe page also includes interactive elements to enhance your cooking experience:

Save Recipe Button: Allows you to save the recipe to your profile for easy access later. Simply click the bookmark icon to add the recipe to your saved recipes.

Star Rating: Users can rate the recipe based on their experience. Hover over and click the stars to leave your rating.

Jump to Recipe Button: If you're interested in getting straight to the cooking details, this button scrolls the page down to the recipe card, which outlines the ingredients and steps.


## How to generate grocery list
Your grocery list takes in what you already have in your pantry and cross checks that with the ingredients needed for the meals that you have planned for the week. This will tell you what you need to buy when you go to the store. You can upload the already owned items in your pantry and the grocery list tab will automatically take all the ingredients needed for your planned recipes and make a list of the ingredients that are missing.
