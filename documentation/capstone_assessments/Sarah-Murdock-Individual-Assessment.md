The purpose of the Self-Assessment and the Team-Assessment is to reflect on all your personal and group accomplishments in Senior Design. 

Part A - Two Paragraphs: What was your individual contribution to this project? Did you apply and build upon the skills identified in your initial assessment from last Fall? What did you do and how did you do it? What did you learn and what competencies did you build? What were your successes, what were you obstacles?

I contributed to frontend UI theme and design, React and routing, Save recipe and meal planning functionality. I built upon my frontend design and javascript skills. I was successful in designing and programming an aesthetically pleasing and functional frontend design for our website. I struggled at times with making the backend work with the frontend but with the help of my teammates we figured it out.

Part B – Two Paragraphs: What did your group accomplish? What did you learn about group work? What aspects of teamwork were successful and what aspects of teamwork were not successful? How did your efforts on the project compare to that of your teammates?  Do any team members deserve special recognition?

We accomplished designing and developing a website that gives home cooks a one stop location for all of their needs from recipe searching to meal planning and grocery list generation. We were successful in assigning each other tasks and helping each other out when needed. We could have been more effective at setting and keeping deadlines for ourselves. 

Shoutouts:
Mary put in a lot of hours and effort into getting the backend running and fixing things in a timely manner when they needed fixed. Preston was very helpful at picking up on some of frontend design when I couldn’t find the time and making the frontend components work together. John did a great job with the search page functionality and being flexible to work on the frontend when needed.
