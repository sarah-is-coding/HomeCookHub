# Final Self Assessment

For this project, I primarily worked on the back-end, specifically in setting up and managing the databases. I also created a custom API that allowed the HomeCookHub website to communicate with the database. We used Firebase to store our data, which is a NoSQL database. All of my previous experience had been with SQL databases, so I needed to learn how NoSQL databases worked and decide the best ways to organize and call our data. While designing the databases, I also created documentation outlining the different API calls and the layout of the database. As the project developed further, I made updates to the database and structure to support the evolving design of the website. Finally, I populated the database with test data and updated that data as was needed by my teammates.

Throughout this project, I became much more familiar with Firebase and NoSQL databases. I also gained competency in javascript, typescript, and fetch protocols through my work on the API. I also helped some to get the api calls implemented in the front end and did some work in react, though that was a minor part overall. My main challenge came in the form of learning how to implement the API. Figuring out how to start it was especially challenging. Once I got going though, things became smoother and I was able to apply what Iâ€™d learned in designing previous calls when I implemented new ones. I was ultimately able to get to the point where I could quickly make changes to support the development work my teammates were doing.
