HomeCookHub: Streamlining the Culinary Experience


The digital era has drastically transformed our lifestyle, including our dining habits. As a
computer science enthusiast nearing my graduation, I am excited to present my senior design
project, "HomeCookHub". It's not just another recipe-sharing platform; it’s an integrative
ecosystem that aims to simplify meal planning and preparation. HomeCookHub provides users
with the tools to upload, share recipes, generate grocery lists, and even create meal plans
tailored to personal dietary preferences and existing pantry stocks. As someone passionate
about technology's impact on our daily lives, I am committed to making this platform user-centric
and efficient.


The robust curriculum of the University of Cincinnati has provided me with both theoretical
knowledge and practical skills to take on such an ambitious project. Courses like Software
Engineering and Database Design & Dev (where I mastered SQL) will guide the backbone
development of HomeCookHub, ensuring a stable, responsive, and scalable application.
Moreover, Programming Languages and Data Structures will inform how the platform handles
and processes vast amounts of data, from individual recipe details to user dietary preferences
and feedback. On the other hand, AI Principles and Applications will play a crucial role in
tailoring recipe suggestions, while my understanding of algorithms, stemming from the Design
and Analysis of Algorithms course, will be fundamental in the search and filtering functions.
My co-op experiences further fortify my approach. At Logging Magic, I was integral in
developing user navigation structures, which will inform the design of HomeCookHub’s user
dashboard and onboarding modules. My expertise in creating responsive web pages will ensure
HomeCookHub is accessible across various devices. With Booz Allen Hamilton, I delved deep
into algorithm optimization, a skill vital for HomeCookHub's recipe suggestions and grocery list
generation functions. Collaborating with teams and presenting findings has honed my
communication skills, ensuring that I can effectively gather user feedback and implement
necessary changes to the platform.


My motivation for HomeCookHub stems from personal experiences. Like many, I’ve found
myself scrambling to find recipes that fit my pantry or dietary needs. I envision HomeCookHub
as a solution that empowers users, fostering a community where culinary enthusiasts,
beginners, and everyone in between can explore, share, and learn. My preliminary approach
begins with user experience; a simple, intuitive interface is paramount. Leveraging tools like
Laravel for backend development and integrating AI for personalized suggestions, I aim to
create an adaptable platform. The app will prioritize security, responsiveness, and user
feedback.


In terms of outcomes, I expect the platform to be user-friendly, efficient in meal planning, and
capable of generating grocery lists that streamline shopping experiences. I plan to set up
periodic review checkpoints, gather user feedback, and analyze user engagement metrics to
gauge the platform's success. In terms of outcomes, I expect the platform to be user-friendly,
efficient in meal planning, and capable of generating grocery lists that streamline hypothetical
shopping experiences in an academic context. To self-evaluate, I'll assess the app's technical
efficiency, responsiveness, and ability to meet the project's objectives as outlined in the course.
By successfully integrating all the listed features and ensuring seamless functionality in a test
environment, I'll consider my contributions successful
