I worked on the back-end functionality of the project. That was my strong suit as I have had a lot of experience working at the back end during my time in co-ops and my previous projects. I was able to apply my skills here and work on the recipe app functionality. I was able to learn full stack development as I was helping in the front end. I added in the Add recipe functionality and there was a whole web page that had to be created for the user to put in the information. I was able to add a couple fetch calls to upload and grab data to and from an API.
 
Additionally, I worked on the recipe search function, I created an algorithm to lookup a recipe once a user types in something in the search bar. I also worked on the log in functionality which we did not end up using in our final project as it was higher priority to implement our key features. It was an obstacle for me as I had never worked on a big web application such as this. My previous experience with web development was a couple years ago so I was pretty rusty. But I was able to learn and work on what needed to be done on our app.
