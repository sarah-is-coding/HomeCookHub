## Hour Summary: Preston Savey
### Hour Summary
**Semester 1:** 48

**Winter Break:** 9

**Semester 2:** 51

## Justification
We started off the semester somewhat slow with basic meetings to figure out our idea and setup the base of our project. I attended all meetings and completed assignments. I worked with Sarah to plan the layout and began fleshing out the different pages we need. I worked primarily on Meal Planning page this semester.

Over Winter break, I continued to refine the design of the parts of the UI I began in the second semester and I finished the Meal Planning page's functionality before passing it to sarah to refine the look of it.

During the second semester, while I continued to contribute to all assignments and meetings, I also finished one of our app's main features the Automated Grocery List generator. After finishing the functionality, I worked on adding API calls throughout the app to integrate the backend with the frontend. I then polished up the look of the app in preparation for the expo.
