<h2>Work Experience</h2>
Medpace (2021-2023)
<br><br>
At Medpace I worked on an application to provide at home clinical trials to customers. The application was developed with the angular framework using HTML, CSS, Typescript, and C# for the backend. I have been there throughout all of my co-op semesters at UC.

<h2>Projects Sought</h2>
I am very open to many different types of projects. I am an artistic person and would love to do a project where this skill would be useful. Through both my elective coursework and free time, I have experimented with Unity and Maya for video game development and animation.

Currently, my only idea for a project would be a more advanced alarm clock app. This app would have a ring connected to the app that could perform various tasks that a normal alarm clock app could not. The main feature of the app would be a second alarm system where the ring would set a second alarm if no movement was detected after the first alarm that you set goes off. This could help avoid oversleeping and could be very useful even in my own personal life. The app could also include features to track sleep patterns and provide data to improve sleep quality as an added bonus.
